# C-20-Template-Project

This is a C++ 20 Template that configured three type of compilers:
1. GCC 12.1.0
2. Clang 14.0.4
3. MSVC

To use all of these compilers, you need to install these compilers. Then, just copy all the files and drag all into a folder named .vscode folder whenever you create a new project.
